description: Though Gorgias was a Sicilian teacher of oratory, the dialogue is more
  concerned with ethics than with the art of public speaking. The ability, professed
  particularly by the Sophists, to make the worse cause appear the better, struck
  Plato as the source of all corruption. The dialogue's chief interest lies, not in
  Gorgias' courteous outline of his art, but in the clash between Socrates, the true
  philosopher, and Callicles, a young Athenian of the stamp of Alcibiades, who brashly
  maintains that might is right.
